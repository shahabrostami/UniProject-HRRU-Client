    <p>There are four cards on a table.</p>
	<p>Each has a letter on one side and a number on the other.</p>
    <p>The cards look like this:</p>
    <div style="margin-left:100px;"><p>9   J   U   2</p></div>
    <p>Here is a rule: If a card has a vowel on its letter side, it has an even number on its number side. </p>
	<p>Which card(s) must be turned over to find out if the rule is true or false?</p>
	<p><a style='font-family: name;'>Answer</a></p>
	<p>The answer is 'U and 9.'.</p>
	<p>Ninety per cent of people get this one wrong, usually by picking U and 2.</p>
	<p>They think they need to confirm the rule by looking for a vowel on the other side of the 2.</p>
	<p>But the rule only says that vowels must have even numbers, not that consonants canâ€™t.</p>
	<p>An odd number on the back of the U, or a vowel on the back of the 9, would show that the rule is false.</p>

    <p>Does the conclusion follow from the premises?</p>
    <p>Premise 1: All living things need water.</p>
    <p>Premise 2: Roses need water.</p>
    <p>Therefore, roses are living things.</p>
	<p><a style='font-family: name;'>Answer</a></p>
	<p> The answer is 'false'.</p>
	<p>A large majority of people endorse this syllogism as valid.<p>
	<p>In fact the argument is flawed, because it is possible that there are no roses among the flowers that fade quickly.</p>
	<p>A plausible answer comes to mind immediately when reading this question. Overriding it requires hard work - 
	the insistent idea that 'it's true, it's true!' makes it difficult to check the logic and most people do not 
	take the trouble to think through the problem.</p>

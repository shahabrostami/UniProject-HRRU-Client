<div><p> Imagine you bought a case of fine Bordeaux wine at $20 a bottle a decade ago. Now the wine sells for $75 a bottle. What will it cost you to now drink a bottle of wine?

A. $0 B. $20
C. $20 plus 10 years interest D. $75 E. It's a savings of $55

Thaler found more than half of all respondents answered zero or a $55 saving. Strictly speaking, the right answer is D, reflecting the opportunity cost of not selling the bottle on the open market. Most people however, focus on the amount already shelled out, the sunk cost.</p></div>

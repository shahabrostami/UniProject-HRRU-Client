	<p>Two taxi companies, the Green and the Bluem operate in the city.</p>
	<p>You are given the following data:</p>
	<div style="margin-left:100px;"><p> * 85% of the taxis in the city are Green and 15% are Blue.</p></div>
	<div style="margin-left:100px;"><p> * A witness identified the cab as Blue. The court tested the reliability 
	of the witness under circumstances that existed on the night of the accident and concluded that the witness 
	correctly identified each one of the two colors 80% of the time and failed 20% of the time.</p></div>
